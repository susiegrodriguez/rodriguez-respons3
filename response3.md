### The problems with Microsoft Word and the Simplicity of Markdown
The first two readings of this module centered  around the floating Behemoth known as Microsoft word. Both Marc Scott, in his blog post _Please stop sending me your shitty Word document_, and Charlie Stross, in his blog post _Why Microsoft Word must Die_ are addressing the looming issue of Microsoft Word and its overreaching dominance in the world of content writing today. One of Scotts main issues is that Microsoft Word, and all its systematic flaws, is inescapable. He blatantly airs his grievances concerning the domination of Microsoft Word, criticizing the fact that many people have now fallen under the assumption that Microsoft Word is the universal form of writing software, making it extremely challenging for people who rightfully do not use Microsoft Word to share and collaborate with other users. Stross, in his blog post, takes Scotts complaints one step further by outlining the reasons why Microsoft Word is so ill-suited for the task that it is meant to preform and by delving into the corrupt history behind the Microsoft Word takeover. In his eyes, Microsoft Word is a monstrous Behemoth that consumes everything in its path, absorbing the creativity of each business that it ingests before spitting out the bones. This he described as the the Microsoft Word “embrace and expand tactic”, a tactic that effectively quells innovation , creating a stagnant environment in which creativity is forced into the limiting box of Microsoft word .docs . He ends his grievance mirroring the same concern that troubled Scott.  The reason they both want Microsoft Word to die is because it has become unavoidable, forcing writers everyday to conform to its constricting demands and holding the world back form further innovation.
	The article, _Markdown: Markup That’s Downright Simple_ Erik Martin talks about the simplicity of Markdown and how this tool’s simple structure can be utilized to easily create plain text documents with out having to deal with the complex makeup language of HTML or the limiting design of Microsoft Word.
###The Importance of Podcasting
In the last two assigned readings focused exclusively on the life of the podcast, its history and its future. The podcasting timeline outlines, in detail, the history of podcasting, from its beginning with the birth of the RSS feed in 1999 all the way to present time, documenting significant events in-between, such as when Apple added podcasts directly into the iTunes store in 2005, spreading the concept of podcasting to a significantly wider audience. While the podcast timeline gives a visual representation of the history of podcasting, Vanessa Quirk’s article, _Guide to Podcasting_ , is focused on developing an in-depth look as the currant state of the podcasting “industry” and from that, attempt to predict where podcasting could go in the future. She uses a number of case studies to exhibit what the existing business models look like today and how they operate, though she notes that “ there is no one-size-fits-all” model. This helps develop and idea of the current podcasting landscape looks like and how it could possibly advance in the future. She also addresses both the strength’s and weaknesses that go along with podcasting, asserting that it derives  much of its strength from its “mobile advantage”, while also being held back by its reliance on advertising as its sole provider of funds. Podcasting is still in its infancy, she claims, and while many of the podcasting companies are thriving today, only the future will tell whether this form of expressing will endure.
###Quotes
1. Firstly you assume that I have Word or some clone of it installed. I know you think the words 'Computer', 'Microsoft', 'Windows' and 'Office' are synonymous, but they're not and there are plenty of people in the world who use * nix operating systems. By sending me a .docx file you're forcing me to find a work around, so that I can use your document.
2. But one by one, Microsoft moved into each sector and built one of the competitors into Word, thereby killing the competition and stifling innovation. Microsoft killed the outline processor on Windows; stalled development of the grammar checking tool, stifled spelling checkers. There is an entire graveyard of once-hopeful new software ecosystems, and its name is Microsoft Word.
3. “In my work, I move in two professional environments: academic writing and technical writing. Markdown works as a plain text authoring tool for both of those environments and minimizes the need for complex applications or additional tags or markup. It bridges the processes of writing, say, on email or forums, and on web editors,”
4. Podcasting’s present and future, particularly its business models, are relevant to digital journalism for two major reasons. First, podcasting is a medium that lends itself to mobile consumption, and thus provides a means for reaching audiences in ways other media cannot. Second, podcasting offers a level of engagement with audiences that is incomparable with other digital media; it thus presents a remarkable opportunity for journalistic outlets to cultivate audience relationships and experiment with new forms of revenue generation
